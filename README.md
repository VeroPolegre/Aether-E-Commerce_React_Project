# <h2><samp> üí¨  Introduction to Aether Project: Recreating the Steam Store  </samp></h2>

The primary objective of the Aether project was to reimagine and recreate the user experience akin to the renowned Steam store. 

The foundational backend infrastructure for Aether was established in my initial Backend Project, aptly named [Aether-E-Commerce_React_Project](https://github.com/VeroPolegre/Aether-E-Commerce_Backend_Project)

As we delve into this project, the aim was to capture the essence and functionality of the Steam store, offering users a familiar yet enhanced experience. Join me on this journey as I shaped Aether into a vibrant and user-friendly e-commerce destination !

# <h2 align="center"><samp>  üöÄ Development  </samp></h2>
The project was centered around creating a robust and user-friendly application, providing an engaging space for users to explore and interact. 
Let's dive into the key components and features!

## Main pages components:
1. **Register:** Allows users to sign up for the platform.
2. **Login:** Enables users to log in to their accounts.
3. **Home:** The main landing page of the app.
4. **Join:** Page for user registration.
5. **Confirmation:** Confirmation page.
6. **Login:** Page for user login.
7. **Cart:** Manages the items selected for purchase.
8. **Library:** Library page.
9. **Community:** Community page.
10. **Profile:** User profile page.
11. **Footer:** Closing component at the bottom of the page.

## Additional Components:
- **Categories:** Component for displaying game categories.
- **Action:** Action category.
- **Role_Playing:** Role-playing category.
- **Strategy:** Strategy category.
- **Adventure:** Adventure category.
- **Simulation:** Simulation category.
- **Sports_and_Racing:** Sports and Racing category.
- **NotFound:** Page not found component.

## React Router Implementation:
- **/home:** The app's main landing page.
- **/login:** Page for user login.
- **/register:** Page for user registration.
- **/profile:** User profile page.

## Key Features:

- **React Context for Efficient State Management:**
  -  React Context to efficiently manage and share state across components without the need for prop drilling. This facilitates a more streamlined and maintainable state management approach.
  
- **SASS and Tailwind for Enhanced Styling and Design:**
  - SASS for a more structured and modular approach to styling, allowing for the creation of reusable styles. Additionally, leverages Tailwind CSS to expedite the styling process with utility-first classes. Tailwind provides a vast set of pre-defined styles, enabling rapid and consistent design implementation.


## API Integration and use:

To enable secure API requests, CORS module was installed:
1. In the backend repo ([Aether-E-Commerce_React_Project](https://github.com/VeroPolegre/Aether-E-Commerce_Backend_Project)): `npm i cors`
2. In `index.js`, the following code was added:
   ```javascript
   const cors = require("cors");
   app.use(cors());
