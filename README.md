# <h2><samp> 💬  Introduction to Aether Project: Recreating the Steam Store  </samp></h2>

The primary objective of this project was to reimagine and recreate the user experience akin to the renowned Steam store. 

The foundational backend infrastructure for Aether was established in my initial Backend Project, named [Aether-E-Commerce_React_Project](https://github.com/VeroPolegre/Aether-E-Commerce_Backend_Project)

The aim was to capture the essence and functionality of the Steam store, offering users a familiar game store experience. Join me on this journey in the development of Aether!

# <h2 align="center"><samp>  🚀 Development  </samp></h2>
The project was centered around creating a robust and user-friendly application, providing an engaging space for users to explore and interact. 
Let's dive into the key components and features!

## Main pages components:
1. **Join:** Page for user registration.
2. **Login:** Enables users to log in to their accounts.
3. **Confirmation:** Confirmation page when their email account is confirmed.
4. **Home:** The main landing page of the app.
5. **Cart:** Manages the items selected for purchase.
6. **Library:** [future roadmap]
7. **Community:** [future roadmap]
8. **Profile:** User profile page.
9. **Footer:** Closing component at the bottom of the page.

## Additional Components [future roadmap]:
- **Categories:** Component for displaying game categories.
- **Action:** Action category.
- **Role_Playing:** Role-playing category.
- **Strategy:** Strategy category.
- **Adventure:** Adventure category.
- **Simulation:** Simulation category.
- **Sports_and_Racing:** Sports and Racing category.
- **NotFound:** Page not found component.

## React Router Implementation:
- **/home:** The app's main landing page.
- **/login:** Page for user login and join.
- **/profile:** User profile page.
- **/library:** [future roadmap]
- **/community:** [future roadmap]

## Key Features:

- **React Context for Efficient State Management:**
  -  Used to efficiently manage and share state across components without the need for prop drilling. This facilitates a more streamlined and maintainable state management approach.
  
- **SASS and Tailwind for Enhanced Styling and Design:**
  - SASS for a more structured and modular approach to styling, allowing for the creation of reusable styles. Additionally, leverages Tailwind CSS to expedite the styling process with utility-first classes. Tailwind provides a vast set of pre-defined styles, enabling rapid and consistent design implementation.


## API Integration and use:

To enable secure API requests, CORS module was installed:
1. In the backend repo ([Aether-E-Commerce_React_Project](https://github.com/VeroPolegre/Aether-E-Commerce_Backend_Project)): `npm i cors`
2. In `index.js`, the following code was added:
   ```javascript
   const cors = require("cors");
   app.use(cors());
